## Context

The project is a Vite plugin for Hono API integration with TypeScript. Currently has basic ESLint and Vitest but lacks comprehensive code quality automation. The goal is to establish a robust pipeline that catches issues early and maintains consistent code quality standards.

## Goals / Non-Goals

- Goals:
  - Automated code formatting with Prettier
  - Pre-commit quality enforcement with lint-staged + Husky
  - Conventional commit enforcement with commitlint
  - Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
  - Test coverage tracking and enforcement
  - Consistent developer experience across team
- Non-Goals:
  - Complex custom linting rules (stick to established configs)
  - Integration with external code quality services
  - Automated version bumping (focus on quality gates)

## Decisions

- Decision: Use Prettier with TypeScript-specific formatting rules
  - Alternatives considered: None (Prettier is de facto standard)
  - Rationale: Consistency across all files, minimal configuration
- Decision: Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit hooks
  - Alternatives considered: simple-hooks, pre-commit (Python-based)
  - Rationale: Native Git hooks integration, excellent ecosystem support
- Decision: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  - Alternatives considered: Travis CI, CircleCI
  - Rationale: Free for public repos, native GitHub integration
- Decision: Vitest coverage with v8 provider
  - Alternatives considered: c8, istanbul
  - Rationale: Native Vitest integration, better TypeScript support
- Decision: commitlint for conventional commits
  - Alternatives considered: custom validation, no validation
  - Rationale: Industry standard, good integration with Husky, automated changelog generation support

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Risk] Pre-commit hooks may slow down commit process
  - Mitigation: Use lint-staged to only check changed files
- [Risk] Strict linting rules may require significant code adjustments
  - Mitigation: Configure rules gradually, provide automated fixes
- [Risk] Conventional commit format may be unfamiliar to team
  - Mitigation: Provide clear documentation and examples, use common types (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- [Trade-off] Additional dependencies increase bundle size
  - Mitigation: All quality tools are devDependencies only

## Migration Plan

1. Add all configurations without enforcing initially
2. Run formatting and linting fixes on existing code
3. Enable pre-commit hooks
4. Test pipeline with sample PR
5. Update team documentation

## Open Questions

- What coverage threshold should be enforced? (Recommend 80% minimum)
- Should formatting errors block commits or be warnings? (Recommend block)
- Need to determine Node.js version support matrix for CI
